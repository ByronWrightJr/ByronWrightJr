## Hey there, my name is Byron. 👋🏽

I am working on getting more into the tech industry by learning coding and other skills. I have so far learned some HTML and CSS from freecodecamp.com and from Harvard University's free online CS50 course I have learned C and Python. I will continue learning and furthering my education. My ultimate goal is to be a software engineer someday. I also like gaming, reading, writing, photography, watching and playing sports, listening to and making music as well as a bunch of other things that would be too much to list here.
