## Hey there, my name is Byron. üëãüèΩ

With over 6 years of experience in the technical field, I am now working on getting even more into the tech industry by learning coding and other skills. I have so far learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from freecodecamp.com and W3Schools. From Harvard University's free online CS50 course, I have learned C and Python. I have dabbled in SQL databases from the freecodecamp YouTube channel as well as learned other technical skills from Programming with Mosha YouTube channel and all sorts of other outlets like blog posts and engineering schematics.
I am going to continue learning and furthering my education by using all the outlets there are that are available on the internet. My ultimate goal is to be a software engineer someday.
